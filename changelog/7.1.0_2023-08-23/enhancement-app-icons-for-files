Enhancement: Use app icons for files

Icons of apps are now rendered next to files that can be opened with them.
Until now oC Web itself defined icons for file types, with this change an icon
can be shown even if oC Web does not know the file type - there just needs to
be an app loaded that supports opening the file type.
